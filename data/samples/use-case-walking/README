Step 1 - Create the human model using the Environment Setup file data/human.env

Step 2 - Add markers to the file as per your configuration
		- This may be done either by using the custom marker setup
		- Or just use the markers already setup in data/human.lua

Step 3 - Compute inverse kinematics (IK) using puppeteer
		- Download and install puppeteer from  
		- Run fit_motion and adjust marker positions until your IK results are satisfactory

Step 4 - Compute inverse dynamics (ID) using RBDL
		- Download and install RBDL from 	
		- Compile the code provided in ./compute_id
		- Run ./compute_id -m human.lua -q animation.csv -f forces.csv -p output_folder
			- You can also use the sample files provided in data and results

Step 5 - Plot IK, ID results using the script plotIKID_results.m
			

READING LUA MODELS

- For examples on how to read Lua models and the fields such as
"points", "constraints", "metadata", have a look at the source files
compute_id/HumanModel.cc and compute_id/HumanModelLuaTypes.h
